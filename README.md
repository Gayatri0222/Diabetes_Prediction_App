## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** to build a **Logistic Regression** model that predicts diabetes outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes).
The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input medical information and receive predictions instantly.

## 📊 **Features Included**

* 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* 🧹 Data preprocessing
* 🧠 Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression)
* 💾 Model saved using **joblib**
* 🌐 Web app created using **Streamlit**
* 🎨 Interactive input sliders & clean UI
* 🚀 Deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud
